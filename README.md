A new Flutter project.

This is the sixth project that I have done in Flutter development

This is project has been developed during my learning fo Flutter development.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)

I have used the audioplayer package fot the first time in my app
